# Face-Recognition-Using-ESP32-CAM-NN-Project
Developing a cost-effective facial recognition system using an ESP32-CAM, LCD, TTL and integrating it with a neural network model CNN.

The aim of this project is to develop a cost-effective facial recognition system using an ESP32-CAM, LCD, TTL. 

The system is designed to perform real-time face detection and recognition with high accuracy, leveraging neural networks for effective classification. 

By integrating affordable hardware and deep learning techniques, the project aims to provide a practical solution for facial recognition in various applications while addressing challenges related to hardware limitations and real-time processing.

➢ Resources Used: 
➢ Programming Language: Python 
➢ Libraries: OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib. 
➢ Tools:ESP32-CAM, OLED display, Jupiter Notebook for initial model development 
➢ Data Source: Celebrity Faces dataset for initial testing, followed by pre-made and custom dataset of user faces for real-world evaluation 


➢ Dataset Used: 
Celebrity Faces Dataset (On Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishesh1412/celebrity-face-image-dataset/data): 
o Used for initial testing and evaluation of the facial recognition system. 
o Provided a diverse set of facial images for training and assessing the model’s performance on known faces.
